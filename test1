Pattern rules may have more than one target. Unlike normal rules, this does not act as many
different rules with the same prerequisites and recipe. If a pattern rule has multiple targets,
make knows that the ruleâ€™s recipe is responsible for making all of the targets.
The recipe is executed only once to make all the targets.
When searching for a pattern rule to match a target, the target patterns of a rule other than the
one that matches the target in need of a rule are incidental: make worries only about giving
a recipe and prerequisites to the file presently in question.
